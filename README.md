## Mission

This website exists to showcase my AWS cloud knowledge. The website is hosted on an S3 bucket as a static website and used Route53 to resolve the name of the website. Additionally used cloudfront for caching at edge to decrease the latency of the website. Obtained a public SSL certificate from AWS Certificate manager to enable https. This personal portfolio shows my career experience and more..
